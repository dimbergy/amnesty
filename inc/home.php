These offices are major hubs for our investigations, campaigns and communications. The new regional offices strengthen the work of Sections who already work at the national level in more than 70 countries. We can now respond quickly to events wherever they happen, and be a powerful force for freedom and justice.</p>
                <p>To stay one step ahead, we are also developing tools using the latest technologies. Such as a mobile phone app that acts as a personal &lsquo;panic button&rsquo; for activists at daily risk of being arrested or detained.</p>
                  <p>Imagine what we can now achieve standing side by side with activists in every corner of the globe. How many more prison doors will open? How many more torturers will be brought to justice? How many more people will realize their rights and live in dignity?</p>',
